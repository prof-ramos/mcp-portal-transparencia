# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 13, 14, 15, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up basic continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated testing, building, and publishing.
# Details:
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18.x
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run test

  build-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18.x
        registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build
    - run: npm publish
      env:
        NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```
2. Configure basic branch protection rules:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
3. Set up NPM_TOKEN secret for publishing

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify CI workflow runs tests on pull requests
2. Test that branch protection prevents direct pushes to main
3. Verify build and publish workflow runs on main branch pushes
4. Test that publishing works with a test release
